I shall therefore send to you the actual books; and in order that you may not waste time in searching here and there for profitable topics,
 I shall mark certain passages, so that you can turn at once to those which I approve and admire.
Of course, however, the living voice and the intimacy of a common life will help you more than the written word.
You must go to the scene of action, first, because men put more faith in their eyes than in their ears, and second,
 because the way is long if one follows precepts, but short and helpful, if one follows patterns.
Cleanthes could not have been the express image of Zeno, if he had merely heard his lectures;
 he shared in his life, saw into his hidden purposes, and watched him to see whether he lived according to his own rules.
Plato, Aristotle, and the whole throng of sages who were destined to go each his different way, derived more benefit from the character than from the words of Socrates.
It was not the class-room of Epicurus, but living together under the same roof, that made great men of Metrodorus, Hermarchus, and Polyaenus.
Therefore I summon you, not merely that you may derive benefit, but that you may confer benefit; for we can assist each other greatly.
Meanwhile, I owe you my little daily contribution; you shall be told what pleased me to-day in the writings of Hecato;[2]
 it is these words: "What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself."
That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone.
You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind. Farewell.
