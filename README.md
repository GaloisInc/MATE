MATE is a suite of tools for interactive program analysis with a focus on
hunting for bugs in C and C++ code. MATE unifies application-specific and
low-level vulnerability analysis using code property graphs (CPGs), enabling the
discovery of highly application-specific vulnerabilities that depend on both
implementation details and the high-level semantics of target C/C++ programs.

See [the online documentation][docs] for more information.
