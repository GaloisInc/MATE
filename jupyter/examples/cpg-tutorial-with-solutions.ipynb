    "# Code Property Graph Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of MATE is a representation of the target program as a \"code property graph.\" A code property graph (CPG) is an annotated graph data structure that unifies the results of many different analyses of a target program, including its:\n",
    "* abstract syntax tree (AST)\n",
    "* call graph (CG)\n",
    "* control-flow graph (CFG)\n",
    "* inter-procedural control-flow graph (ICFG)\n",

    "* control-dependence graph (CDG)\n",
    "* points-to graph (PTG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these representations in a single graph makes it possible to write queries over the graph that reason about the structure and behavior of the program and discover potential vulnerabilities.\n",

    "MATE does not analyze C or C++ source code directly, but instead first compiles programs to LLVM bitcode, a low-level, procedural intermediatere presentation used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Analyzing bitcode directly allows MATE to process any language that compiles using LLVM and simplifies the number of coding constructs the system must understand.\n",

    "* Complex expressions that might involve multiple arithmetic operations or loads or stores to memory are decomposed into sequences of simple instructions such as `load`, `store`, or `add`.\n",
    "* Stack allocations are explicit via calls to the `alloca` instruction (though at higher optimization levels they are frequently compiled away).\n",
    "* The code is in *static single assignment* (SSA) form: each variable has a single definition and only values explicitly stored in memory locations may be directly mutated. Places where loops or other control structures mean that multiple dynamic occurences of a definition could reach the same instruction, explicit [phi instructions](https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.0/docs/LangRef.html#i-phi) are introduced to track the dependencies.\n",
    "* The bitcode includes a number of elements for tracking debug information relating back to the original source code of the program, including directives such as `!dbg !71` and calls to debugging intrinsics, such as `@llvm.dbg.declare`, which will be converted into DWARF debugging information embedded in the compiled binary."

As a result, simply following these dataflow edges in the graph will report that `a` flows to both `c` and `d` and that `b` flows to both `c` and `d`. In this case, the cause of the imprecision is the failure of the analysis to track C's stack-based call discipline, which ensures that each call to `propagate` returns to its original callsite.\n",
