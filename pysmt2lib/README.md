# Python ANTLR SMTLibv2 Parser and Lexer

This is a package that was generated from a slightly modified version of the ANTLRv4 SMTLibv2 Grammar file found at the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antlr/grammars-v4/f6cbd3e2c22718a3e8e269a436c7ce30354573ee/smtlibv2/SMTLIBv2.g4

The modification made is to make parsing a replacement SMT variable easier.
