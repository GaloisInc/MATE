MATE: Merged Analysis To prevent Exploits
=========================================

..
   The following paragraph is duplicated in ../README.md and overview.rst;
   updates to one should be reflected in the other(s).

MATE is a suite of tools for interactive program analysis with a focus on
hunting for bugs in C and C++ code. MATE unifies application-specific and
low-level vulnerability analysis using code property graphs (CPGs), enabling the
discovery of highly application-specific vulnerabilities that depend on both
implementation details and the high-level semantics of target C/C++ programs.

For a high-level overview of MATE, see :doc:`overview`. To start using MATE to
explore a program, see :doc:`quickstart`. Contributors should read
:doc:`hacking`.

The `source code <https://github.com/GaloisInc/MATE>`_ and `documentation
<https://galoisinc.github.io/MATE/>`_ are available online.
